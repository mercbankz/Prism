      `# Chapter 1: Investment vs. Speculation

The first and most obvious distinction between the investor and the speculator is in their attitude toward stock-market movements. The speculator's primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor's primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices.

## The Defensive Investor

The defensive investor is one who seeks safety and freedom from bother. They should be satisfied with the normal annual return of 8-10% and should not expect to beat the market consistently.

### Rules for the Defensive Investor:

1. **Adequate but not excessive diversification** - Not less than 10 different issues and not more than about 30
2. **Each company should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed** - This means substantial assets, strong balance sheets, and conservative debt levels
3. **Each company should have a long record of continuous dividends** - At least 20 years of uninterrupted dividend payments
4. **Price should not be excessive in relation to earnings** - Not more than 25 times average earnings of the past seven years

## The Enterprising Investor

The enterprising investor is willing to devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both sound and more attractive than the average. They can expect to earn better than average returns over the long term.

### Opportunities for the Enterprising Investor:

1. **Large companies selling below their working-capital value** - These are rare but can be very profitable
2. **Special situations** - Merger arbitrage, liquidations, reorganizations
3. **Growth stocks at reasonable prices** - Companies with superior growth prospects trading at reasonable valuations

## Margin of Safety

The central concept of investment is the margin of safety. This means buying securities at prices sufficiently below their intrinsic value to provide a cushion against future declines.`,

      `# Chapter 2: The Investor and Inflation

Inflation is the silent thief that erodes purchasing power over time. For investors, understanding inflation and its impact on different asset classes is crucial for long-term wealth preservation.

## Historical Impact of Inflation

From 1913 to 2023, the U.S. dollar has lost approximately 96% of its purchasing power due to inflation. This means that what cost $1 in 1913 would cost about $30 today.

### Inflation's Effect on Different Assets:

**Stocks**: Historically, stocks have provided the best protection against inflation over long periods. Companies can raise prices to maintain profit margins, and dividends often increase with inflation.

**Bonds**: Fixed-income securities are particularly vulnerable to inflation. When inflation rises, bond yields must increase to maintain real returns, causing bond prices to fall.

**Real Estate**: Property values and rental income typically rise with inflation, making real estate a good hedge against inflation.

**Commodities**: Direct commodity investments can provide inflation protection, but they're volatile and don't generate income.

## Strategies for Inflationary Periods:

1. **Focus on quality companies** with pricing power
2. **Consider inflation-protected securities** like TIPS
3. **Diversify internationally** to reduce country-specific inflation risk
4. **Maintain a portion in real assets** like real estate or commodities`,

      `# Chapter 3: A Century of Stock-Market History

Understanding market history helps investors avoid the emotional pitfalls that lead to poor decisions. Market cycles repeat themselves, and those who understand history are better prepared for the future.

## Major Market Cycles (1900-2023):

**1900-1929**: The Roaring Twenties saw unprecedented speculation and leverage, culminating in the 1929 crash.

**1930-1949**: The Great Depression and WWII created a lost generation for investors, with stocks remaining below 1929 levels until 1954.

**1950-1966**: Post-war prosperity led to a secular bull market, with the Dow rising from 200 to 1000.

**1967-1982**: High inflation and economic uncertainty created a volatile period with no real gains for buy-and-hold investors.

**1983-2000**: The greatest bull market in history, driven by falling interest rates, technological innovation, and the internet boom.

**2001-2009**: The dot-com crash and financial crisis created significant volatility and losses.

**2010-2023**: Recovery and growth, driven by low interest rates and technological advancement.

## Key Lessons from History:

1. **Markets are cyclical** - Bull markets are followed by bear markets
2. **Long-term trends matter** - Despite short-term volatility, stocks have provided superior returns over decades
3. **Valuation matters** - Buying at high valuations leads to poor long-term returns
4. **Diversification works** - Spreading risk across assets and time reduces portfolio volatility`,

      `# Chapter 4: General Portfolio Policy

The foundation of successful investing lies in establishing sound portfolio policies that align with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

## Asset Allocation Principles:

### Age-Based Allocation:
- **100 - Age = Stock Allocation**: A simple rule suggests subtracting your age from 100 to determine stock allocation
- **Conservative Approach**: Some suggest 110 - age for those with longer life expectancies
- **Risk-Adjusted**: Consider your risk tolerance, not just age

### Core Asset Classes:

**Stocks (Equities)**: 40-80% depending on age and risk tolerance
- Provide growth and inflation protection
- Higher volatility but superior long-term returns
- Include both domestic and international exposure

**Bonds (Fixed Income)**: 20-60% depending on age and risk tolerance
- Provide income and stability
- Lower volatility but modest long-term returns
- Include government, corporate, and international bonds

**Real Estate**: 5-15% for diversification
- REITs provide exposure without direct ownership
- Offers inflation protection and income generation

**Commodities**: 0-10% for inflation hedge
- Gold, oil, agricultural products
- High volatility, no income generation

## Rebalancing Strategy:

Regular rebalancing (quarterly or annually) helps maintain target allocations and forces you to buy low and sell high.`,

      `# Chapter 5: The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

For the defensive investor, common stocks should form the foundation of a balanced portfolio, but selection criteria must be strict and conservative.

## Selection Criteria for Defensive Investors:

### Financial Requirements:
1. **Large Size**: Minimum market cap of $2 billion
2. **Strong Financial Condition**: Current ratio of at least 2:1, debt-to-equity below 30%
3. **Earnings Stability**: Positive earnings for at least 10 consecutive years
4. **Dividend Record**: Uninterrupted dividends for at least 20 years
5. **Earnings Growth**: At least 33% growth over the past 10 years
6. **Reasonable Valuation**: P/E ratio below 15 for average of past 3 years

### Quality Indicators:
- **Blue-chip companies** with recognizable brands
- **Market leaders** in their respective industries
- **Conservative management** with shareholder-friendly policies
- **Geographic diversification** in revenue sources

## The 50-50 Portfolio:

Graham recommended a simple 50-50 split between stocks and bonds for defensive investors, with rebalancing when either asset class moves more than 5% from target allocation.

### Benefits of the 50-50 Approach:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Discipline**: Forces systematic buying and selling
- **Risk Management**: Limits exposure to any single asset class
- **Emotional Control**: Reduces the temptation to time the market`,

      `# Chapter 6: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor

The enterprising investor can achieve superior returns by devoting time and effort to security analysis and portfolio management, but only if done systematically and with proper risk management.

## Advanced Strategies for Enterprising Investors:

### Value Investing Opportunities:
1. **Net-Net Stocks**: Companies trading below their net current asset value
2. **Special Situations**: Mergers, spin-offs, liquidations, reorganizations
3. **Distressed Securities**: Bonds and stocks of companies in financial distress
4. **Small-Cap Value**: Undervalued smaller companies overlooked by institutions

### Growth Stock Investing:
- **Reasonable Growth**: Companies growing 15-25% annually, not 50%+ growth stories
- **Quality Metrics**: Strong balance sheets, consistent profitability, competitive moats
- **Valuation Discipline**: Never pay more than 25x earnings for growth stocks
- **Diversification**: Limit individual positions to 5-10% of portfolio

### Sector Rotation:
- **Economic Cycles**: Overweight sectors that benefit from current economic conditions
- **Valuation Cycles**: Move between growth and value based on relative valuations
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: Adjust allocation based on interest rate environment

## Risk Management for Enterprising Investors:

1. **Position Sizing**: No single position should exceed 10% of portfolio
2. **Stop Losses**: Establish clear exit strategies before entering positions
3. **Portfolio Limits**: Even enterprising investors should maintain 25% in bonds
4. **Regular Review**: Monthly portfolio review and quarterly strategy assessment`,

      `# Chapter 7: Security Analysis for the Lay Investor

While detailed security analysis is complex, individual investors can apply simplified analytical frameworks to make better investment decisions.

## Simplified Financial Analysis:

### Key Financial Ratios:
1. **P/E Ratio**: Price-to-earnings should be reasonable (under 20 for most stocks)
2. **PEG Ratio**: Price-to-earnings growth should be under 1.5
3. **Debt-to-Equity**: Should be under 50% for most companies
4. **Current Ratio**: Should be above 1.5 for liquidity
5. **ROE**: Return on equity should be above 15%
6. **Dividend Yield**: Should be reasonable (2-4% for most stocks)

### Quality Checks:
- **Revenue Growth**: Consistent top-line growth over 3-5 years
- **Profit Margins**: Stable or improving margins
- **Cash Flow**: Strong operating cash flow relative to earnings
- **Management**: Experienced leadership with track record of value creation

## Red Flags to Avoid:

1. **Excessive Debt**: Debt-to-equity ratios above 70%
2. **Declining Margins**: Consistent margin compression
3. **Accounting Issues**: Restatements, auditor changes, or SEC investigations
4. **Management Turnover**: Frequent changes in key personnel
5. **Industry Headwinds**: Structural challenges in the company's sector

## The 15-Point Checklist:

Graham developed a 15-point checklist for stock selection that individual investors can adapt for their own use, focusing on financial strength, earnings stability, and dividend consistency.`

      `# Chapter 6: Building Your First AI Investment Tool

This chapter provides a step-by-step guide to building a simple but effective AI-powered investment analysis tool.

## Project Overview:

We'll build a stock screening tool that:
1. Fetches financial data for a list of stocks
2. Calculates key financial ratios
3. Uses machine learning to score stocks
4. Provides investment recommendations

## Step 1: Data Collection

\`\`\`python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def fetch_stock_data(symbols, period='1y'):
    """Fetch stock data for multiple symbols"""
    data = {}
    for symbol in symbols:
        try:
            ticker = yf.Ticker(symbol)
            data[symbol] = ticker.history(period=period)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching data for {symbol}: {e}")
    return data

# Example usage
symbols = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'TSLA']
stock_data = fetch_stock_data(symbols)
\`\`\`

## Step 2: Feature Engineering

\`\`\`python
def calculate_financial_ratios(stock_data):
    """Calculate key financial ratios"""
    ratios = {}
    
    for symbol, data in stock_data.items():
        if len(data) > 0:
            # Calculate returns
            data['Returns'] = data['Close'].pct_change()
            
            # Calculate volatility (annualized)
            volatility = data['Returns'].std() * np.sqrt(252)
            
            # Calculate Sharpe ratio (assuming 2% risk-free rate)
            mean_return = data['Returns'].mean() * 252
            sharpe_ratio = (mean_return - 0.02) / volatility
            
            ratios[symbol] = {
                'Volatility': volatility,
                'Sharpe_Ratio': sharpe_ratio,
                'Total_Return': (data['Close'][-1] / data['Close'][0]) - 1
            }
    
    return pd.DataFrame(ratios).T

# Calculate ratios
ratios_df = calculate_financial_ratios(stock_data)
print(ratios_df)
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Machine Learning Model

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def build_ml_model(ratios_df):
    """Build a machine learning model for stock scoring"""
    
    # Prepare features (using all available ratios)
    X = ratios_df.dropna()
    
    # Create target variable (future returns - simplified example)
    y = X['Total_Return']  # In practice, you'd use future returns
    
    # Remove target from features
    X = X.drop('Total_Return', axis=1)
    
    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
    )
    
    # Scale features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
    
    # Train model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
    
    return model, scaler, predictions

# Build the model
model, scaler, predictions = build_ml_model(ratios_df)
\`\`\`

## Step 4: Investment Recommendations

\`\`\`python
def generate_recommendations(model, scaler, ratios_df, top_n=3):
    """Generate investment recommendations"""
    
    # Prepare features for prediction
    X = ratios_df.dropna()
    X_features = X.drop('Total_Return', axis=1, errors='ignore')
    
    # Scale features
    X_scaled = scaler.transform(X_features)
    
    # Make predictions
    scores = model.predict(X_scaled)
    
    # Create recommendations
    recommendations = pd.DataFrame({
        'Symbol': X.index,
        'Score': scores,
        'Volatility': X_features['Volatility'],
        'Sharpe_Ratio': X_features['Sharpe_Ratio']
    })
    
    # Sort by score and return top recommendations
    recommendations = recommendations.sort_values('Score', ascending=False)
    
    return recommendations.head(top_n)

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = generate_recommendations(model, scaler, ratios_df)
print("Top Investment Recommendations:")
print(recommendations)
